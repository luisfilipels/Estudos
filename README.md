# Interview-Preparation

## A repo with answers to coding questions from multiple sites (and from Cracking the Coding Interview)

This repository contains the answers to questions I've solved starting from June 2019. Overall, as of 07/03/2020, it contains more than 250 questions from sites such as HackerRank, InterviewBit, LeetCode and Pramp, as well as questions from the book Cracking the Coding Interview (6th edition).

### 1. About this repo

I've been studying for coding interviews and coding competititons since 2019, and using GitHub for storing the answers for questions I've solved. Whenever I got absolutely stumped for hours trying to solve some particular question, I'd go straight to YouTube or GitHub in the hopes of finding someone who solved it and could, hopefully, give an explanation about that particular question could be solved. Of course, if I couldn't find some explanation for the question, I'd have to try even harder to comprehend it and come up with a good algorithm to solve the question. 

Recently, I thought about giving more visibility to this repo, hoping it can be of help to others that, like me, are trying their best to study for coding interviews and/or competitions. As such, I'm in the process of organizing this repo in a way that makes it easy to navigate through to find the question you may be searching for.

There are Easy, Medium, and Hard questions for each site, although I'd consider that most of the answers in this repo are for medium level questions. Some of the answers are quite old, and as such, may not be optimal answers or easy to understand, although they have all been accepted by each respective site's judge, with very few exceptions.

Regarding the code itself for each answer, I have been using exclusively Java 8 for the algorithms to each question, and I plan on continuing to do so, as I highly recommend this language for coding interviews (although I can't say the same for coding competitions). Also, I made comments in some of the files containinig answers to sepcific questions, those that I found to be the hardest ones for me to comprehend in case I wanted to review those questions some weeks or months after answering. Some comments are full explanations for the questions, and others are mostly observations. Feel free to contact me directly, or open an issue in case you see something wrong in some answer, or, if you would wish for me to provide (or improve) comments to whatever question you're having a hard time with :)
